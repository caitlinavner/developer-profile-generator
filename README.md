# developer-profiler-generator

This Node app will generate a professional profile in .pdf format. Running 'node index.js" will prompt the user to enter their Github user name and choose a color. It will then generate a .pdf profile made from that Github users information.

The PDF will be populated with the following:

Profile image
User name
Links to the following:
User location via Google Maps
User GitHub profile
User blog
User bio
Number of public repositories
Number of followers
Number of GitHub stars
Number of users following

Problems encountered:
I was able to generate a PDF using this node app. However, the pdf doesn't display the correct information. Although, an html page does generate and displays all of the required info.
Update!!
PDF now generates and displays all required info.
